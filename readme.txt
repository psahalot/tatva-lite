There are three ways to install your theme. It can be installed by manually uploading the files to the themes folder using an FTP application,
it can be installed by downloading from the WordPress Theme Directory within the Dashboard or it can be installed by uploading the theme zip
file that you downloaded.

Use the following instructions to install & activate Tatva using your preferred method.

Manual installation:

1. Unzip the files from the Tatva zip file that you downloaded
2. Upload the Tatva folder to your /wp-content/themes/ directory
3. Click on the Appearance > Themes menu option in the WordPress Dashboard
4. Click the Activate link below the Tatva preview thumbnail

Install from the WordPress Theme Directory:

1. Click on the Appearance > Themes menu option in the WordPress Dashboard
2. Click the Install Themes tab at the top of the page
3. Type 'Tatva' in the search field, without the quotes, and then click the Search button
4. Click the Install Now link below the Tatva preview thumbnail

2. Click the Install Themes tab at the top of the page
3. Click on the Upload link just below the two tabs at the top of the page
4. Click the Browse button, browse to the folder that contains the theme zip file, select it and then click the Open button

== Getting Started ==

Since Tatva is a starter theme to kick off your own awesome theme, the first thing you want to do is copy the tatva theme folder 
and change the name to something else. You'll then need to do a three-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

1. Search for tatva inside single quotations to capture the text domain.
2. Search for tatva_ to capture all the function names.
3. Search for tatva with a space before it to replace all the occurrences of it in comments.
   (You'd replace this with the capitalized version of your theme name.)

or, to put it another way...

Search for:'tatva'
 Replace with:'yourawesomethemename'
Search for:tatva_
 Replace with:yourawesomethemename_
Search for: tatva
 Replace with: YourAwesomeThemeName

Lastly, update the stylesheet header in style.css and either update or delete this readme.txt file.
